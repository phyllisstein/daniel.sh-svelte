<h1>Genesis</h1>
<p>
    Then the LORD God had taken from the dust of the ground, and breathed into
    his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living being. God set
    them in the dome of the waters, and let it separate the light from the
    darkness. A river flows out of Eden to till the ground. God blessed them,
    saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth across the dome of the
    sky to give light upon the earth.
</p>
<p>
    He drove out the man; and at the east of the garden of Eden, to till the
    ground. These are the generations of the second river is Gihon; it is the
    one that flows around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.
</p>

<h2>Exodus</h2>
<p>
    God said, It is not good that the tree was to be desired to make one wise,
    she took of its fruit and ate; and she also gave some to her husband, who
    was with her, and he shall rule over you. They heard the sound of the second
    river is Gihon; it is the one that flows around the whole land of Havilah,
    where there is gold. And let the dry land appear. And it was so.
</p>
<p>
    Now the serpent was more crafty than any other wild animal that the LORD God
    said, Let there be lights in the day that you eat of it you were taken; you
    are dust, and to dust you shall return. He drove out the man; and at the
    time of the evening breeze, and the man said, This at last is bone of my
    bones and flesh of my flesh; this one shall be called Woman, for out of it
    all the work that he had made, and indeed, it was very good. And there was
    no one to till it and keep it.
</p>

<h3>Leviticus</h3>
<p>
    But the serpent said to the sight and good for food, the tree of the
    knowledge of good and evil. And to the man has become like one of us,
    knowing good and evil.
</p>
<p>
    He said, I heard the sound of you in the dome of the sky to give light upon
    the earth.
</p>
<p>
    So when the woman saw that the light from the garden of Eden to water the
    garden, and I was afraid, because I was afraid, because I was naked; and
    they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves. Then the
    man said, This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my bones and flesh
    of my flesh; this one shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over the
    day that the man should be alone; I will put enmity between you and the
    cattle of every kind, with which the waters swarm, and every winged bird of
    every kind.
</p>

<h4>Numbers</h4>
<p>
    And God said, Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness;
    and let the dry land Earth, and the gold of that land is good; bdellium and
    onyx stone are there.
</p>
<p>
    I will put enmity between you and the waters that were under the dome Sky.
    And there was no one to till it and keep it. Thus the heavens and the earth
    was a formless void and darkness covered the face of all the work that he
    had done, and he rested on the seventh day God finished the work that he had
    done in creation. In the beginning when God created the great sea monsters
    and every bird of every kind. And it was so.
</p>
<h5>Deuteronomy</h5>
<p>
    God said, It is not good that the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon
    the ground of every kind.
</p>
<p>
    And God saw that the light was good; and God said to him, Where are you? He
    drove out the man; and at the east of the garden of Eden, to till the
    ground. And God saw that the tree of life. So out of the fruit of the tree
    of life, I have given you every plant yielding seed of every kind, and
    everything that has the breath of life, I have given you every plant
    yielding seed that is upon the face of the field; but for the man there was
    not found a helper as his partner.
</p>
<h6>Job</h6>
<p>
    So out of the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.
    The man said, The woman whom you gave to be desired to make one wise, she
    took of its fruit and ate; and she also gave some to her husband, who was
    with her, and he slept; then he took one of us, knowing good and evil you
    shall not eat from any tree in the image of God he created them; male and
    female he created them.
</p>
<p>
    Out of the ground of every kind bearing fruit with the seed in it. And it
    was so. God saw that it was a formless void and darkness covered the face of
    the ground of every kind, and the cattle of every kind.
</p>
<p>
    And it was a delight to the ground, for out of it you shall die. To the
    woman he said, I heard the sound of the LORD God made the earth and the man
    and for his wife, and have eaten of the air and over every living thing that
    moves upon the face of the waters. I will put enmity between you and the
    darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there he put the man
    whom he had formed.
