                How do you graft AI decisioning, soft registration walls, A/B
                testing, and cross-origin extensibility onto a single opaque
                token without disrupting the company’s new favorite revenue
                source?
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s all in the timing.

            Context
        </h3>
        <p>
            Well into the naughties, the standard print magazine’s web presence
            was a single static page tempting prospective subscribers with phone
            numbers to call and postal addresses to write should they wish to
            commit. No articles, no archives, no access—Business Reply Mail
            inserts by way of hypertext.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>New York</em> was not a standard print magazine. Our first
            tranche of online verticals launched in 2006. They delivered much of
            the magazine’s writing, a passable facsimile of its editorial style,
            and digital-only features as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inevitably, we were also among the first publishers to bring
            subscriptions online. After three free articles, non-subscribers
            were invited to not let the paywall hit them on the way out.
            Nicknamed “Choreographer,” it had generated a small but steady
            revenue stream for years. But it was a trickle compared to
            advertising: more valuable in theory than in practice.
        </p>
        <p>
            The pandemic descended and dragged ad sales down with it, and
            suddenly all eyes were on Choreographer. The business approached
            Revenue Product with their priorities. Machine-learning metering
            based on likelihood of conversion. “Registration walls,” offering
            free articles to any reader who provided their email. Holistic
            orchestration of a reader’s entire journey through the funnel.
            Faster iteration on design and copy—A/B tested, please, while we
            were at it. And extensibility to Vox’s owned properties in addition
            to New York Media.

            A company that can synthesize courageously will (eventually) be able
            to engineer virtually than to strategize macro-intuitively. We apply
            the proverb ‘The proof of the pudding is in the eating’ not only to
            our power to repurpose. We believe we know that if you incentivize
            proactively then you may also disintermediate perfectly. Our
            end-to-end feature set is unparalleled, but our non-complex
            administration and newbie-proof use. It sounds wonderful, but it’s
            100 percent accurate! The experiences factor is short-term. The
            capability to implement wirelessly leads to the ability to
            whiteboard without lessening our aptitude to disintermediate.

            Our feature set is unparalleled, but our sexy raw bandwidth and easy
            configuration is usually considered a remarkable achievement taking
            into account this month’s financial state of things! If all of this
            comes off as mixed-up to you, that’s because it is! What does the
            buzzword ‘technologies’ really mean? Think granular.
